⚙️ Setup and InstallationPrerequisitesA modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).Python 3 installed on your system (essential for using the content_manager.py script).A local web server for running index.html. This is required because the website uses the fetch API to load data.json, which is subject to CORS policy when run directly from file:///.1. Get the Project FilesClone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it to your local machine.git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
2. Running the WebsiteDue to browser security restrictions (CORS policy for fetch API with local files), you must serve index.html through a local web server.A simple way to do this if you have Python installed:Open your terminal or command prompt.Navigate to the root directory of the project (where index.html is located).Run the command:For Python 3: python -m http.serverFor Python 2 (if available): python -m SimpleHTTPServerThe server will usually start on port 8000. Open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:8000Alternatively, you can use other local server tools like VS Code's "Live Server" extension.3. Using the Python Content ManagerThe content_manager.py script empowers you to edit the website's content stored in data.json.Ensure Python 3 is installed.Open your terminal or command prompt.Navigate to the root directory of the project.Run the script using:python content_manager.py
Follow the on-screen menus to manage products, site configuration, FAQs, etc.⚠️ Important Note: If you encounter issues saving data.json (especially on Windows or if the script was run without sufficient privileges previously), you might need to run the script with administrator privileges (e.g., "Run as administrator" for cmd.exe or PowerShell on Windows, or sudo python content_manager.py on Linux/macOS). This is often due to file permissions.📖 Usage GuideManaging ContentYou have two primary ways to manage the website's content:✍️ Directly Editing data.json:You can open data.json in a text editor and modify its content directly. The structure includes:siteConfig: General site settings like the persistent header message and Telegram links.telegramBotLink: Crucial for the receipt page's "Go to Telegram" button. Ensure this is a correct, full Telegram URL (e.g., https://t.me/YourTelegramUsernameOrBot).products: An array of product objects, each with an id, name, description, isOutOfStock status, and an array of plans.plans: Each plan has an id, name, price (USD), mmksPrice, duration, and isOutOfStock status.paymentMethods: An array of payment methods, each with an id, name, and an instructions object (e.g., accountName, accountNumber, notes for KPay; uid, currency, notes for Binance).adminNote: An object with title, isVisible (boolean), and content (an array of strings, where each string is a paragraph).faq: An array of FAQ objects, each with an id, question, and answer.🐍 Using content_manager.py (Recommended):This script provides a user-friendly CLI to manage all sections of data.json:Main Menu Options:Manage Products: Add, edit, view details, remove products. Includes sub-management for product plans (add, edit, remove, toggle stock). You can also toggle the overall stock status of a product.Edit Site Configuration: Change the persistent header message and key Telegram links used by the site. Prompts will guide you to enter full URLs for Telegram links.Edit Admin Note: Modify the title, paragraphs of content, and visibility of the admin note.Manage FAQs: Add, edit, or remove FAQ entries.Manage Payment Methods: Edit the details (name, account info, notes) for existing payment methods like KPay and Binance.The script handles ID generation for new items where applicable and provides clear prompts for editing.Website Flow🏠 Homepage (index.html): Displays the admin note (if visible), the list of products, and the FAQ section.🖱️ Product Interaction: Clicking on an available product takes the user to product options.⚙️ Product Options: User can choose to view product details or see available plans.🛒 Plan Selection: User selects a pricing plan for the chosen product.💳 Payment Method Selection: User chooses a payment method.🧾 Payment Instructions: Detailed instructions for the selected payment method are shown, along with the total amount.✅ Receipt Page: After the user indicates they've completed payment, a receipt summary is shown with a "Go to Telegram" button for order confirmation. This button uses the telegramBotLink from data.json.🎨 Customization🖌️ Styling: Modify css/style.css to change the visual appearance of the website.🧱 Content Structure: While data.json can be extended, be aware that adding new top-level keys or significantly changing the structure of existing items (like products or plans) would require corresponding updates to js/script.js to display the new data and potentially to content_manager.py to manage it.🎬 Video TutorialWatch the comprehensive video guide on setting up and using this project:📺 Project Tutorial on YouTube (Note: Original link was https://youtu.be/f3gEA14XUK8 which might be a placeholder.
